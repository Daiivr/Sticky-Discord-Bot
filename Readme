# Pokémon Legends Sticky Bot

A Discord bot for Pokémon Legends that allows for sticky messages in Discord channels. This bot ensures that important messages stay visible by periodically reposting them.

## Features

- Sticky messages that stay at the bottom of the channel.
- Commands to set the color, image, title, and content of sticky messages.
- Permissions-based command access.
- Auto-deletion of command messages to keep the chat clean.
- Persistent storage of the last sticky message ID to ensure proper cleanup on bot restart.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.6.0 or higher)
- npm (v7.20.0 or higher)

        user: 'your-database-user',
        password: 'your-database-password',
        database: 'your-database-name',
